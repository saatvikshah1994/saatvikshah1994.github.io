## Background
I just started my first internship in the US, and with the (small amount of)money coming in and all, decided to spend some time reading and summarizing some books on investing. Based on the recommendations of a friend I looked up this [blog](https://sowmayjain.com/) and this book - Stocks to Riches is the first he recommends - **strongly recommends**.

**Intro:** *This chapter introduces investing to the readers.In doing so he discusses types of investors, investment products, investment procedures, and why its useful. He finally covers the golden principle of diversification and proposes an action plan.*

The chapter starts by defining what "Investing" exactly means by using a family dinner discussion. He explains that investments are not only monetory such as in stocks, but its a broad term which includes charity, health, education and a lot more.

**Investment Products** or different ways of investing as summarized below are discussed.

Three basic ways in which people can invest are by:

1. **Going Long**: Buy investment products and hold them over a long period of time. The motive is to earn long term returns like dividends or capital appreciations.
2. **Going Short**: Sell *borrowed* investment products to buy them later(with the hope their future prices would bottom out). Watch [**The Big Short**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/) also cause its an awesome movie, or read this [piece](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) to fully grasp this concept.
3. **Trading:** Cycles of buying and selling in short periods to earn fast and high profits.

Investors can be classified based on how they use investment procedures with which investment products. For example, its clear that a stock trader is one who is *trading stocks*. Other classifications include commodities traders, day traders, real estate speculater, etc. Each of these classes, has some plan in mind while investing depending on his situation and appetite for risk. For instance a young man in his 20s has lesser to lose by taking higher risks as compared to an old man in his 60s - thus their plans would be considerably different.

The author discusses two golden principles in investing here: **Trends and Diversification**. He explains that one should use a combination of diversified investment products/vehicles and not put all of his money into one type of product. In this way if one of the investment products hits unexpected losses, the damage would be moderate. He also asks people to remain alert to the changing trends, and accordingly change their investment products from time to time. For example, the real estate market had a sharply improving trend post 2003, and was subdued between 1998-2003 which would have been a great time to invest in them.

He concludes the chapter by advising readers to follow the provided **Plan of Action**.

1. Make an Investment plan for yourself.
2. Determine the appropriate investment products/vehicles for this plan.
3. Understand that trading is not investing - it is very risky and has a high potential of hitting hard.

**Intro:** *This chapter focusses on helping begginners understand the pros and cons of long term investing(The Cash Flow Model) vs. short term investing(speculation/trading/capital gains). The case study of Infosys is discussed to help readers get a better perspective.*

The author kicks off the chapter by stating that there are two ideologies of a typical investor:

1. **The Cash Flow Model** which treats investments as long term assets with constantly returning benefits such as dividends. The investment product such as a stock might go through many ups and downs. It is important to be patient at both of these times and continue holding on. Their overall appreciation over the long term is an additional source of good news for the investor following this model.

2. **The Capital Gains Model** which works on short term investing strategies to maximize profit. This source can end up being a much larger source of income than the *Cash flow methodology* but at a higher risk and effort. For instance a short term investor could have sold off Hindustan Lever shares when they were about to start dropping for Rs. 210 in November 2003, and buy them back in August 2004 at Rs. 120 when they had severely dropped. They would end up having the same stocks as the Cash flow model followers with a high intermediary profit.

The author gives the **case study of Infosys** in an attempt to explain how speculation can get awry. Their stocks were performing well, and had shot up by over 100% between 1999 to mid 2000s. Yet by the end of 2000 there was a steep decrease. Both could not be explained by anything specific happening to the company. At the point when they were at their record high, it was important for speculators to understand that their growth of over 100% if been persistent would put their income over the GDP of a country like USA - which is just not practical. Thus it was a huge miscalculation by speculators to invest when it was at its peak assuming that it would continue to appreciate at the same rate.

The author provides an **interesting point of view on speculation.** He holds it respondible for funding innovative businesses. It can go wrong when people:

1. Dont understand the difference between *Speculation and Investments*.
2. Speculate without the correct skillset.
3. Speculate with high risk i.e. enough to end up with losses.

His **concluding points** are:

1. Stocks might go through many ups and downs(stress on downs), but good stocks generally give good long term returns and appreciation.

2. Short term investing can only work with the correct skillset and approriately timing the markets.
