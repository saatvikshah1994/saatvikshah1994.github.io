<h3 id='scores'>Prep Time</h3>
It's been almost 5 months since I gave my GRE(precisely *14/08/2015*) in the first month of my seventh semester of engineering. I actually began preparing in my sixth semester but due to project work and internships, it was done haphazardly. My main preparation was precisely **1 month** before the GRE(from around 15<sup>th</sup> July). 
<h3 id='scores'>What this post will cover?</h3>
This post will first give a brief introduction to the GRE. It'll then outline the steps in preparing, provide additional valuable tips and finally present a list of invaluable articles and references.

The diagram above is self-explanatory, though I'll clarify a few things.

1. You can get either of Format 1 or 2 in your exam which is completely random. One section will always be an **experimental section**, which will be any one amongst the sections which appear 3 times instead of 2.  i.e. In Format 1 since the Verbal Section appears 3 times, any 1 of those 3 sections can be the experimental one. So you should give your best to every section without bothering about which would be experimental. **Magoosh** covers this in detail if you would like to read [more](http://magoosh.com/gre/2012/the-experimental-section-on-the-gre/). 
2. The GRE takes approximately **3 hours 45 minutes** and is truly enough a test of energy and patience. This is why mock tests are a **must**.
3. The **level of Quant is simpler** compared to Verbal, which is why Verbal requires a lot of practice over a longer time. Its also important to remember that if you are going for a technical graduate program, the adcoms will place a **greater emphasis on your Quant scores**.

<h2 id="prep">Prep Guide</h2>
Here I'll cover both the resources required and how best to use these resources to prepare for each section of the GRE. I **strongly recommend** that you join popular Facebook groups of students prepping for MS/PhD like [this](https://www.facebook.com/groups/msinusfall16), [this](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MSinUS2016HEB/) and [this](https://www.facebook.com/groups/516843291802835/). Here you'll find students sharing their own experiences. More importantly many share the resources I'll be mentioning further in this post on Google Drive links which you could then download for free.

<h4>How to Prepare?</h4>
The first thing you should do, before starting any prep, is to take the **Math Diagnostic Test** in the the *Manhattan 5lb book*. This diagnostic test is vital to finding out those topics needing an in-depth review. Go through those questions that you have erred in and list out the topics which you are finding particularly difficult.

The second step you should take is to go through the chapter titled **GRE Math Review** in the *Official Guide*(or OG in short). By the day of the test you should know each and every formula here, so be sure to revise those formulae which you are having difficulty in applying.

Okay so now let's get back to **addressing your weaknesses**. Open up the *Nova Math Bible* and start going through those topics which you had found difficult. Ensure that you go through the **entire section** from the introductions and solved examples to the hard problems. Then pick up the *Manhattan 5lb book* and go through all the questions of that topic. This should be sufficient to improve your foundations in weak topics.

For the topics you have found very easy, you should go through all the questions of that topic in the *Nova Math Bible* definitely. If you can practice more, then even go through such topics from the *5 lb book*.

Finally when you are aa few weeks away from the exam - be sure to solve the Quant questions from the OG and GRE Quant OG. I repeat - **you must solve all the questions from the OGs**.

We'll discuss mock tests later, but remember one thing for now. After giving each mock test, be sure to analyze and pin point the type of problems you are mainly facing difficulty in. Then be sure to solve questions of that subtopic from the *5lb book*.

If there's any topic which you are finding **exceptionally difficult**, your best bet is to pick up the related *Manhattan Strategy Guide* and go through that topic in detail.

Finally, be clear that you should always aim for a perfect **170/170** in Quant, which can only be ensured by sufficient practice.

<h4>How to Prepare?</h4>
The Verbal section is the most challenging section of the GRE, but can nonetheless be aced with the correct preparation. Unlike Quant, where you would already be aware of how to tackle problems, you may not have an already well developed vocabulary. Thus, I'll *first address vocab skill development*, and then on the *main verbal questions prep*. Remember that both these complement each other and it is thus a must that you devote at least some time to your vocab development.

<h4>Working with Wordlists to develop Vocabulary</h4>
Firstly, download the **Quizlet** app or go to their website ASAP. Its an excellent excellent application
