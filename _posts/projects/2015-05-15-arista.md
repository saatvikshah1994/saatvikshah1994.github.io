##Where
[Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/en/), Bangalore

##Objective
Optimizing port channel membership setup for Layer 3 Multicast

##Methodology/Features
Designed and implemented improvements for port channel handlers and reduced reprogramming of data structures in L3 Mulicast, so as to achieve significant speedup in networks heavily using port-channels. The entire workflow involved :

1. Port to Port-Group mapping
2. Register programming
3. Hitless Restart functionality
4. Internal data structure additions and modifications

Below is a simplified broad overview of the port channel workflow changes we made.

##Results
1. Designed and developed the complete scheme to meet
requirements
2. Wrote and ran multiple unit, product and stress tests which showed that the system is robust
