## Where
[Zine Research Lab](http://zine.co.in), NIT Jaipur - Built for the North East Indian Frontier Railways.

##Objective
Complete system for location-sensitive preventive gear maintenance recording and centralization on a server, followed by report generation for administrative view.

##Methodology/Features
The entire project is a combination of an Android application for managing user recording of maintenance information, and a web application for querying records and viewing reports about aggregated information.

1. **Android application**: The android app has a search functionality, based on which the closest gears in the radius of the user's location are listed. Based on the type of gear selected, a form is populated. When filled, the recorded information is recorded and synced to a central server.
2. **Web application**: The recorded information can be queried and structured in the format of different types of reports, which can be viewed by the administration.
