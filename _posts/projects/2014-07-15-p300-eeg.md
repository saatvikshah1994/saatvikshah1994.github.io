## Where
[*Zine Research Lab*](http://www.zine.co.in), NIT Jaipur

## Objective
EEG or Electroencephalogram refers to recordings of electrical activity in the brain. [P300](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P300_%28neuroscience%29) is a unique signal elicited by the brain on receiving a specific stimulus. It is most commonly known for being used as a EEG based speller, where the user can, simply with his focus, spell a word. Our objective was  to recognize *P300* event related potential in raw EEG generated while a user experiences the P300 speller.

## Methodology
We applied *signal processing* based feature extraction, which was fed to a linear classifier ensemble. We experimented with the following significant types of features:

1. **Time-Series features**
2. **Frequency-Series features**
3. **Wavelet features**
4. **Statistical and Experiment related features**

and a few more... Finally since the EEG data consisted of a lot of data to work with, we ended up with a large variety and quantity of features to experiment with. To enable modular organization, fast code execution and stacked feature vectors we setup a framework which utilises *caching, parallel computing and modularity*.

## Results

1. *Accuracy of 97% at ideal training interval.*
2. *Complete framework for future research usage.*
