##Methodology/Features
Developed a wxPython based desktop application tool that automatically adds, manages and scrapes movie information from popular reviewing websites [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/) and [RottenTomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/). This information is stored in a SQL table, which is queried for its management. For faster web-scraping, processes are managed in a multi-threaded manner. Some of the features include:

1. Automatic search and add movies
2. Scraping basic movie information - Synopsis,Cast,Genres,etc
3. Scraping site-specific information such as ratings and top250 status
4. Scraping reviews from popular movie critics
5. Cross-Platform and Multi-themed
