## Where
[*Fundamental Research Group*](http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/frg/wiki/index.php/Fundamental_Research_Group), IIT Bombay

## Objective
**750 GB** - that's the whoopingly huge amount of data generated by an average EdX course per week.

Our objective was to create a research workbench for automating the extraction-transform-load pipeline, data analysis and visualization of student behavior from user logs generated on [IITBombayX](https://www.iitbombayx.in/): IITBombay's version of EdX.

## Methodology

It took us(a team of 5) to churn out a working prototype on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Firstly, it iterated through, to clean and organize loads of unstructured data via a combination of shell and python scripting. The internal data was then pushed onto different [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) tables. From here, [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) was used to make customized queries on the data, which were further processed to obtain useful inferences. These inferences were then visualised using [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).

## Results

1. *Django web application running on a multinode Hadoop cluster*
2. Our research was carried forward by the FRG team and graduate students to create a personalized tutoring system and improve IITBombayX.

P.S: To get selected for this internship I had to create teaching software in different categories(Physics, Chemistry, Maths, English) for the IITBombay [EkShiksha](http://www.ekshiksha.org.in/) initiative. The code lives [here](https://github.com/saatvikshah1994/ekalavyasoftwares).
