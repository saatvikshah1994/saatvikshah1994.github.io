####Bio : Hi, I'm a senior undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology, Jaipur](http://mnit.ac.in/dept_cs/index.php). I am also a member of *[Zine](https://www.zine.co.in)*, a robotics and research group of the university. While at Zine, I've worked on several projects starting from a huge RC Airplane to Artificial Intelligence. Lately, I've been working on problems in Applied Machine Learning, to fields such as Signal Processing and Natural Language Processing, and on research in Deep Learning. You'll find more about my work at my [**Portfolio**]({{ site.url }}/portfolio.html). Feel free to drop me a mail to ask about anything at *saatvikshah1994@gmail.com*.
